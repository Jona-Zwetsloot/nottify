# a few tips
Once you've installed nottify you can either call it a day or customize your experience further. **If you want to do some customizing, then here's a few tips:**

‚öôÔ∏è Look in the config.php file for settings to modify.

üîë Enter API client details for Spotify, Genius and/or Last.fm in config.php. It's free and unlocks multiple features, such as Spotify streaming, more artist data and viewing what your friends are listening to.

üìú Missing your language? nottify supports English and Dutch by default, but you can add languages by duplicating `locales/en.json`, modifying it, and saving it under `locales/[countrycode].json`.

üóëÔ∏è The cache folder is as the name indicates a cache folder. You can safely remove it whenever if you want to.

üìÇ The library folder contains your music. You can safely replace audio, image and lyric files (you'll need to reset the cache though). Added files will not be recognised, deleted files will create ghost songs/images/lyrics in your library until you delete them there too, so please don't do that. Also, don't touch the JSON files unless you know what you're doing.
